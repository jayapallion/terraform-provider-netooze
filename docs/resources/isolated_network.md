# netooze_isolated_network (Resource)

Netooze Isolated Network resource allows you to create isolated (private) networks. Servers in the same location as the network can be joined to it via network ID. 

## Example Usage

### Create a new network

```hcl
resource "netooze_isolated_network" "example_network" {
  name = "example-network"
  description = "Internal network with description"
  location = "am2"
  network_prefix = "192.168.0.0"
  mask = 24
}
```

### Join a server

```hcl
resource "netooze_server" "example_server" {
  name = "example-server"
  # ...
  nic {
    network = resource.netooze_isolated_network.example_net.id
    network_type = "Isolated"
    bandwidth = 0
  }
```
